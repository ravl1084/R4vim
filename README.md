# R4vim

*This vim plugin is in the very early stages of development*

This plugin was inspired by wanting the power of Vim for editing R scripts, while
having the capability of running commands and code snippets in R.

## Goals
* Provide this functionality for Vim.
* Simplicity. Send commands to R.

## Acknowledgements
* [Nvim-R](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R): for the great syntax highlighting.
